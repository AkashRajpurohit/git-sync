`git-sync` is a CLI tool designed to help you back up your GitHub repositories. This tool ensures you have a local copy of your repositories, safeguarding against potential issues such as account bans or data loss on GitHub.

By using `git-sync`, you can easily clone or update your repositories to a specified local directory.

## Why `git-sync`?

Remember when `@defunkt` [GitHub account got banned?](https://twitter.com/defunkt/status/1754610843361362360) Well, he is the co-founder of GitHub so he did get this account un-banned but what if you are not that lucky? Recently I have seen many developers getting their GitHub account banned and losing access to their repositories. Some may be able to recover their account (but there is delay in that) and some may not be able to recover their account at all.

With the increasing reliance on cloud-based repository hosting services like GitHub, it's crucial to have a backup plan. While GitHub is highly reliable, unexpected events like account bans, outages, or accidental deletions can occur.

`git-sync` provides a straightforward way to back up all your repositories locally, ensuring you have access to your code whenever you need it. It does this by doing a bare clone of all your repositories in a specified directory so that you can recover your code in case of any unforeseen circumstances as well as the file size of your backups is minimal.

## Features

- **Backup All Repositories:** Automatically clone or update all your GitHub repositories to a local directory.
- **Bare Clone:** Efficiently back up repositories using bare clones to save space and speed up the process.
- **Concurrency:** Sync multiple repositories concurrently to reduce the time required for backup.
- **Configuration File:** Easily manage your settings through a YAML configuration file.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.22 or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Using `go get`

```bash
go get github.com/AkashRajpurohit/git-sync
```

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/git-sync.git
cd git-sync
go install
go build
```

### With Docker

```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/config/:/git-sync -v /path/to/backups:/backups ghcr.io/akashrajpurohit/git-sync:latest
```

Or you can use the `docker-compose.yml` file to run the container.

```yaml
services:
  git-sync:
    image: ghcr.io/akashrajpurohit/git-sync:latest
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config/:/git-sync
      - /path/to/backups:/backups
```

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Download Pre-built Binaries

Pre-built binaries are available for various platforms. You can download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/git-sync/releases) page.

## Usage

### Configuration

Before using `git-sync`, you need to create a configuration file named `config.yml`. The default path for the configuration file is `~/.config/git-sync/config.yml`.

Here's an example configuration file:

```yaml
# Configuration file for git-sync
# Default path: ~/.config/git-sync/config.yml
username: your-github-username
token: your-personal-access-token
repos: []
backup_dir: /path/to/backup
include_all_repos: true
include_forks: false
```

- `username`: Your GitHub username.
- `token`: Your GitHub personal access token. You can create a new token [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#about-personal-access-tokens). Ensure that the token has the `repo` scope.
- `repos`: A list of repositories to back up. If `include_all_repos` is set to `true`, this field is ignored.
- `backup_dir`: The directory where the repositories will be backed up. Default is `~/git-backups`.
- `include_all_repos`: If set to `true`, all repositories owned by the user will be backed up. If set to `false`, only the repositories listed in the `repos` field will be backed up.
- `include_forks`: If set to `true`, forks of the user's repositories will also be backed up. Default is `false`.

### Commands

#### Sync Repositories

To sync your repositories, run the following command:

```bash
git-sync
```

This command will clone or update all your repositories to the specified backup directory.

#### Version

To check the version of `git-sync`, run the following command:

```bash
git-sync version
```

#### Help

To view the help message, run the following command:

```bash
git-sync help
```

### Setup Periodic Backups

#### Unix-based Systems

You can set up periodic backups using [cron jobs or systemD timers](https://akashrajpurohit.com/blog/systemd-timers-vs-cron-jobs/?ref=git-sync). For example, to back up your repositories every day at 12:00 AM, you can add the following cron job:

```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/git-sync
```

Replace `/path/to/git-sync` with the path to the `git-sync` binary.

#### Windows

You can set up periodic backups using Task Scheduler. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Task Scheduler.
2. Click on `Create Basic Task`.
3. Enter a name and description for the task.
4. Choose the trigger (e.g., `Daily`).
5. Set the time for the trigger.
6. Choose `Start a program` as the action.
7. Browse to the `git-sync` binary.
8. Click `Finish` to create the task.
9. Right-click on the task and select `Run` to test it.
10. Your repositories will now be backed up periodically.

Or you can use Powershell script to run the `git-sync` binary.

```powershell
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "path\to\git-sync.exe"
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At "12:00AM"
Register-ScheduledTask -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -TaskName "GitSyncTask" -Description "Daily Git Sync"
```

Replace `path\to\git-sync.exe` with the path to the `git-sync` binary.
